###### PROJECT BRIEF #####

Project Brief

This project explores the disparities in access to education worldwide, focusing on how regional, economic, and gender-based inequalities affect learning opportunities. We aim to highlight key educational metrics such as literacy rates, enrollment in primary, secondary, and tertiary education, gender differences, and the digital divide in online learning access. Through interactive visualizations, we will showcase how economic factors, education spending, and internet access shape educational outcomes across different regions. Our innovative feature is a Sankey diagram, which will map students' educational journeys from primary to higher education, showing dropout rates and economic influences.
