    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
    <p>Education is a cornerstone of societal progress, yet access to quality education remains uneven across the globe,
      often reflecting deep-seated economic, geographic, and gender-based inequalities. Our project, "Inequality in
      Global Access to Education," seeks to uncover and visualize these disparities by leveraging comprehensive datasets
      and advanced visualization techniques. By focusing on key metrics such as literacy rates, enrollment levels,
      gender disparities, and digital access, we aim to shed light on the multifaceted barriers that hinder learning
      opportunities worldwide. Using interactive visualizations, including a novel Sankey diagram to track educational
      pathways, our project not only highlights the current state of global education but also provides a foundation for
      policymakers and stakeholders to identify actionable solutions.</p>

      <div class="text">Global Disparities in Education Access: A Choropleth Visualization
        <p>A choropleth map vividly highlights the stark disparities in global education access, exposing regions where
          opportunities remain scarce. By visualizing data geographically, this tool reveals the correlation between
          socio-economic status, geography, and education inequality. It serves as a powerful reminder of the need for
          targeted interventions in underserved areas. Such visualizations empower policymakers, educators, and
          advocates to address systemic barriers and foster global progress. Bridging these gaps is crucial for
          achieving universal education goals.</p>

      <div class="text">Education gender gap. How will it shape our future?
        <p>The education gender gap continues to influence the global landscape, affecting economic growth, innovation,
          and social equity. When girls and women lack access to education, societies lose potential leaders, skilled
          workers, and agents of change. Bridging this gap could lead to a more inclusive future, fostering equality and
          improving livelihoods. Investments in gender-equal education are essential to create sustainable solutions for
          the world's challenges. As we close the gap, a brighter, more balanced global future becomes possible.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Our project on "Inequality in Global Access to Education" provides a detailed exploration of the diverse factors
      that shape educational opportunities across the world. Through dynamic visualizations such as the choropleth map,
      scatterplot, grouped bar chart, and line chart, we have highlighted critical trends and disparities in literacy,
      enrollment, and access to online learning. The centerpiece of our work, the interactive Sankey diagram, offers a
      unique perspective on students' educational journeys, revealing how economic and social factors influence dropout
      rates and transitions to higher education. As we finalize the remaining elements, we envision this project as a
      comprehensive tool that not only raises awareness about educational inequalities but also empowers decision-makers
      to develop data-driven policies for a more equitable future in education.</p>
